## at Universit√© Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris VI)

This repo hosts the various search engines developped for the "Information Retrieval" course.

It has 3 parts:

### 1. An accurate text search engine
Find the most relevant scientific article (from 3000 in our database) for a query.

**Example**:
Query: "Number-theoretic algorithms, especially involving prime number series,
sieves, and Chinese Remainder theorem"
Article results:
- A Prime Number Generator Using The Treesort Principle
- An Improved Algorithm to Produce Complex Primes
- Greatest Common Divisor of n Integers and Multipliers

### 2. An image search engine
Find the most relevant images with semantic analysis (for a query such as "tree frog", it's better to return images of Wood Frogs than images of guitars).

### 3.  A diverse text search engine
Using diversity to cover all the topics for a query. This search engine avoids redundancy and doesn't return the same image. It returns various diverse images that suit the need of the user.
